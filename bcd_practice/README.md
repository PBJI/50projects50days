### Repo Overview
Hi, this is Purshotam here. This repo was forked repo, however I have made certain useful feature changes that allows people explore it without hassle of opening each project separately.

### Features added
I have added two buttons at the top right corner, which allows anyone to surface these 51 projects (1 among these is made by me) in both direction.

Note: Some projects require reloads before their best experience, so reload if you think that the project currently in selection has lost some features while you were exploring other projects.

Bonus: Added a feature that persists the last viewed project even after browser session.

### Installation:
This repo uses node. Make sure you have node installed on your device. Secondly, if you want you can directly host from root directory skipping node depedency.

If you have node install, then kindly run the following commands in sequence to start the project to explore:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the browser and surf localhost:port (most probably localhost:3000). Here port to be connected with is mentioned in terminal output after the last command. 3000 is default in lite-server (a small npm package that can start a local server).
